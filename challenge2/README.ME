#Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

The program evaluates the speed input and applies the following logic:

If the speed is less than or equal to 70 km/h, it prints "Ok".
If the speed exceeds 70 km/h, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit, it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.
